## 3 Data Examples

##### 3.1 Pennsylvania Lung Cancer data

This dataset consists of counts of lung cancer incidence in Pennsylvania for the year 2002 as reported by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. This case data was paired with the corresponding population data from the 2000 Census. Furthermore, smoking data is provided from a behavioral risk study conducted by the [Pennsylvania Department of Health](https://www.health.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and are presented as the percentage of adults who were current smokers sometime between 1996 and 2000. Both population and case counts are stratified by gender, age (0-39, 40-59, 60-69 and 70+) and race (white and other) for a total of 16 strata levels. We plot lung cancer incidence per 1000 individuals in Figure \@ref(fig:pennLC)


```{r pennLC, fig.cap="Lung cancer incidence per 1000 in Pennsylvania in 2002 ", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(SpatialEpi)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pennLC_sf, aes(fill = cases))
```

##### 3.2 Scotland Lip Cancer among Males in 1975-1980
AFF agriculture farming and fishing
The expected numbers of disease were calculated by the method of Mantel and Stark 

Figure \@ref(fig:scotland)

```{r scotland, fig.cap="lung cancer among males in Scotland between 1975-1980", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(SpatialEpi)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = scotland_sf, aes(fill = cases))
```

##### 3.2 Upstate New York Leukemia
```{r , fig.cap="Upstate New York Leukemia", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(SpatialEpi)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = NYleukemia_sf, aes(fill = cases))

```



## Figures and Tables {.unnumbered}


Standard \LaTeX references will work as well (e.g. Fig. \ref{fig:view}).

<!-- 2. The RMarkdown way -->

```{r view, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An example image.", echo = FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("view.jpg")
```

<!-- 3. The pandoc way -->

```{=html}
<!-- 

![An example image. Text *can* be processed with markdown.](view.jpg){#view width = 100%}

 -->
```
```{=html}
<!-- 
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}
-->
```
| Item    | Quantity |
|:--------|---------:|
| Widgets |       42 |
| Gadgets |       13 |

: (\#tab:widgets) An Example Table.

## Citations {.unnumbered}

LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, like @Figueredo:2009dg, and the citep command for a citation in parentheses [@Figueredo:2009dg].

## Mathematics {.unnumbered}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let $$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$ denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

## Lists {.unnumbered}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

1.  Like this,
2.  and like this.

or bullet points...

-   Like this,
-   and like this.

or with descriptions...

-   **Word** Definition
-   **Concept** Explanation
-   **Idea** Text

We hope you find write\LaTeXÂ useful for your PeerJ submission, and please let us know if you have any feedback. Further examples with dummy text are included in the following pages.
