\title{Besag-Newell Cluster Detection Method}
\description{
Besag-Newell cluster detection method.  There are differences with the original paper and our implementation:
\itemize{
\item we base our analysis on \eqn{k} cases, rather than \eqn{k} \emph{other} cases as prescribed in the paper.
\item we do not subtract 1 from the \emph{accumulated numbers of other cases} and \emph{accumulated numbers of others at risk}, as was prescribed in the paper to discount selection bias
\item M is the total number of areas included, not the number of additional areas included.  i.e. \eqn{M} starts at 1, not 0.
\item p-values are not based on the original value of \eqn{k}, rather the actual number of cases observed until we view \eqn{k} or more cases.  Ex:  if \eqn{k = 10}, but as we consider neighbors we encounter 1, 2, 9 then 12 cases, we base our \eqn{p}-values on \eqn{k=12}
\item we do not provide a Monte-Carlo simulated \eqn{R}:  the number of tests that attain significance at a fixed level \eqn{\alpha}
}
The first two and last differences are because we view the testing on an area-by-area level, rather than a case-by-case level.

\usage{besag_newell(geo, population, cases, expected.cases=NULL, k, alpha.level)}
\arguments{
  \item{geo}{an \code{n x 2} table of the (x,y)-coordinates of the area centroids}
  \item{cases}{aggregated case counts for all \code{n} areas}
  \item{population}{aggregated population counts for all \code{n} areas}
  \item{expected.cases}{expected numbers of disease for all \code{n} areas}
  \item{k}{number of cases to consider}
  \item{alpha.level}{alpha-level threshold used to declare significance}
}
\details{
For the \code{population} and \code{cases} tables, the rows are bunched by areas first, and then for each area, the counts for each strata are listed.  It is important that the tables are balanced:  the strata information are in the same order for each area, and counts for each area/strata combination appear exactly once (even if zero). 
}
\value{
List containing
  \item{clusters}{information on all clusters that are \eqn{\alpha}-level significant, in decreasing order of the \eqn{p}-value}
  \item{p.values}{for each of the \eqn{n} areas, \eqn{p}-values of each cluster of size at least \eqn{k}}
  \item{m.values}{for each of the \eqn{n} areas, the number of areas need to observe at least \eqn{k} cases}
  \item{observed.k.values}{based on \code{m.values}, the actual number of cases used to compute the \eqn{p}-values}
} 
\note{
The \code{clusters} list elements are themselves lists reporting:\cr\cr
\tabular{ll}{
  \code{location.IDs.included} \tab ID's of areas in cluster, in order of distance\cr
  \code{population} \tab population of cluster\cr
  \code{number.of.cases} \tab number of cases in cluster\cr
  \code{expected.cases} \tab expected number of cases in cluster\cr
  \code{SMR} \tab estimated SMR of cluster\cr
  \code{p.value} \tab \eqn{p}-value\cr
}
