\title{Compute Expected Numbers of Disease}
\description{Compute the internally indirect standardized expected numbers of disease.}
\usage{expected(population, cases, n.strata)}
\arguments{
  \item{population}{a vector of population counts for each strata in each area}
  \item{cases}{a vector of the corresponding number of cases}
  \item{n.strata}{number of strata considered}
}
\details{
The \code{population} and \code{cases} vectors must be \emph{balanced}: all counts are sorted by area first, and then within each area the counts for all strata are listed (even if 0 count) in the same order.
}
\value{
\item{expected.cases}{a vector of the expected numbers of disease for each area}
}
