The next steps will install the open source geospatial libaries necessary for
your computer to read in ESRI shapefiles. Fortunately you only have to do this
once.

## Installation Instructions

### Mac Users

* Install either Xcode (available for free in the App Store) or the [Command
Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/). Youâ€™ll need to
have a (free) Apple ID.
* In your Mac menu bar go to System Preferences... -> Security & Privacy ->
unlock the lock on the bottom left of panel -> select "Allow apps downloaded
from": Anywhere -> relock the lock
* Open Terminal by going to a Finder window -> Applications -> Utilities ->
Terminal. You open new tabs in Terminal by pressing command+T.
* In Terminal
    + Run `sudo xcodebuild -license`, scroll to the bottom and type `agree` to
    agree to the licence.
    + Open a new tab and run `xcode-select --install`
* Install Macports as per the [Quickstart](http://www.macports.org/install.php)
instructions.
    + You have already completed steps 1 and 2.
    + To know what version of OS X you have click on the Apple icon on the top
    left of the menu bar -> About This Mac
* Install the [`gdal`](http://www.gdal.org/) and [`geos`](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) 
geospatial libraries.
    + In Terminal open a new tab and run `sudo port install gdal`
    + In Terminal open a new tab and run `sudo port install geos`
* Install the `rgdal` package to interface the `gdal` geospatial library with R
    + Under [Downloads](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html) 
    select "Package Source".  It should be named `rgdal_X.Y-Z.tar.gz` where
    `X,Y,Z` denote the version number.
    + In Terminal open a new tab and run `R CMD INSTALL
    ~/Downloads/rgdal_X.Y-Z.tar.gz` where `X,Y,Z` are changed to match the name
    of the file you just downloaded
* Install the `rgeos` package to interface the `geos` geospatial library with R
    + Under [Downloads](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos/index.html) 
    select "Package Source".  It should be named `rgeos_X.Y-Z.tar.gz` where
    `X,Y,Z` denote the version number.
    + In Terminal open a new tab and run `R CMD INSTALL
    ~/Downloads/rgeos_X.Y-Z.tar.gz` where `X,Y,Z` are changed to match the name
    of the file you just downloaded

### Windows Users

* Follow the instructions in [Quick Start for OSGeo4W Users](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)
* In R, run `install.packages("rgeos", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source")`

### Linux Users

I'm going to assume you know what you're doing!



## Testing

After installing the prerequisite packages, test that both the `rgdal` and `rgeos` packages are installed by running

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
```
